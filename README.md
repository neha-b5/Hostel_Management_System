# Hostel_Management_System
#### I have developed a hostel management system using HTML and PHPMyAdmin, hosted and tested locally with XAMPP. The system caters to two user types: admin and staff. Admin privileges include adding, deleting, and updating staff and resident details, as well as assigning residents to specific staff acting as floor managers. Staff access is restricted to viewing lists of staff and residents. The staff will also be able to view the resisdent alloted to any particular staff.

### Installation Steps:
#### 1) Copy the hostel_system folder and put it inside "xampp/htdocs/".
#### 2) Open PHPMyAdmin and create a database "db_csia".
#### 3) Import the "tables.sql" into the database.
#### 4) Open your browser and type "http://localhost/hostel_system"

### LogIn details:
#### Admin username: admin
#### Admin Password: test1234

#### Staff username: staff
#### Staff Password: test2345
